# Symposium AI - Project Context for Claude

## Project Overview
React Native mobile app where AIs debate topics and users can chat with multiple AI providers simultaneously. The app's unique value proposition is the AI Debate Arena where different AIs can debate any topic in real-time, plus the BYOK (Bring Your Own Keys) approach that saves users money compared to multiple AI subscriptions.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: React Native with Expo
- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode)
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit
- **Navigation**: React Navigation
- **Styling**: Theme-based with light/dark mode support
- **Animation**: React Native Reanimated
- **Testing**: Jest (configured but not extensively used)

## Current Architecture State
✅ **COMPLETED: Proper Atomic Design Architecture Implemented**

### Architecture Achievements
1. **True atomic components** - `atoms/` contains only Box.tsx (pure View wrapper)
2. **Clean separation** - 12 molecules (simple combinations) and 20 organisms (complex logic)
3. **No duplicates** - All ThemedX components removed, single source of truth
4. **Proper responsibilities** - Each layer follows atomic design principles

### Migration Status
- ✅ Proper atomic design fully implemented
- ✅ All components in correct folders by complexity
- ✅ TypeScript compilation: ZERO errors
- ✅ ESLint: ZERO warnings or errors
- ✅ App fully functional with all features retained
- 📄 Migration completed as per `ATOMIC_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`

│   ├── molecules/      # Simple combinations (12 components: Button, Typography, etc.)
│   └── organisms/      # Complex business logic (20 components)
├── screens/            # 8 main screens

## Key Features
1. **AI Debate Arena** - Watch different AIs debate any topic in real-time (Premium: custom topics)
2. **Multi-AI Chat** - Chat with multiple AI providers simultaneously
3. **Web Search** - Real-time web search with cited sources (ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity)
4. **Create Mode** - Generate and refine images with multiple AI providers (DALL-E, Gemini)
5. **Hallucination Shield** - Multiple AIs fact-check each other for accuracy
6. **BYOK (Bring Your Own Keys)** - Use existing API keys, save vs multiple subscriptions
7. **Personality System** - 8 unique personalities to customize AI responses (Premium feature)
8. **Expert Mode** - Choose specific models and control costs (Premium feature)

## Development Commands

### Quality Checks (MUST PASS BEFORE ANY COMMIT)
```bash
npx tsc --noEmit        # TypeScript compilation - ZERO errors allowed
npm run lint            # ESLint - ZERO errors or warnings allowed
```

### Running the App
```bash
npm start               # Start Expo development server
npm run ios            # Run on iOS simulator
npm run android        # Run on Android emulator
```

### Common Issues & Solutions
1. **Metro cache issues**: `npx expo start -c` (clear cache)
2. **Type errors after changes**: Check theme structure `theme.colors.text.primary` not `theme.colors.text`
3. **Import errors**: Ensure importing from correct layer (atoms/molecules/organisms)

## Coding Standards

### Component Creation Rules (Now Enforced!)
1. **Atoms** = Pure React Native wrappers only (currently just Box.tsx)
2. **Molecules** = Simple combinations like Button, Typography, Card (12 total)
3. **Organisms** = Complex components with business logic (20 total)
4. **No duplication** = All ThemedX components eliminated

### Quality Requirements
- ✅ TypeScript must compile with ZERO errors
- ✅ ESLint must pass with ZERO warnings  
- ✅ All components must follow atomic design principles
- ✅ Commit only clean, working code
- ✅ Test affected screens after changes

### Git Commit Format
```
feat: [component] - description
fix: [component] - description  
refactor: [component] to atomic architecture
```

## Architecture Documentation

### Project Documentation
- `docs/ATOMIC_MIGRATION_PLAN.md` - ✅ Completed atomic architecture migration
- `docs/STORE_SUBMISSION_CHECKLIST.md` - App Store and Play Store submission guide
- `docs/FIREBASE_SETUP.md` - Firebase authentication and backend setup
- `docs/IAP_CONFIGURATION.md` - In-app purchase configuration guide
- `docs/PREMIUM_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Premium features implementation guide

### Key Components Structure
- `atoms/Box` - Only atom, pure View wrapper with style props
- `molecules/Typography` - Replaced all ThemedText usage
- `molecules/Button` - Standard button component
- `organisms/` - All complex components with business logic

## AI Providers Configured
- Claude (Anthropic)
- ChatGPT (OpenAI)
- Gemini (Google)
- Nomi
- Replika
- Character.AI

## Architecture Highlights
1. **Clean Structure** - Proper atomic design with clear separation
2. **No Duplication** - Single source of truth for all components
3. **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript compliance with zero errors
4. **Maintainable** - Clear component hierarchy and responsibilities

## Development Best Practices
1. Use React Native components directly in screens when appropriate
2. Use `Box` from atoms for simple View wrappers with style props
3. Use `Typography` from molecules for all text with theming
4. Place complex components with business logic in organisms
5. Run TypeScript and ESLint checks before every commit

## Important Notes for Future Development
- **MAINTAIN** the atomic design structure - atoms are ONLY pure wrappers
- **ENSURE** TypeScript and ESLint pass with zero errors before commits
- **TEST** affected screens after component changes
- **FOLLOW** atomic design principles when creating new components
- **COMMIT** frequently with clear, descriptive messages

## Project Status & Goals

### ✅ ACHIEVED
1. ✅ Proper atomic design architecture implemented
2. ✅ 100% TypeScript type safety maintained
3. ✅ Zero ESLint errors or warnings
4. ✅ Clean, maintainable component structure
5. ✅ Rebranded from MyAIFriends to Symposium AI

### 🎯 NEXT STEPS
1. 📱 Implement Firebase authentication
2. 💳 Add in-app purchases (react-native-iap)
3. 🎨 Create new Symposium AI app icons and splash screens
4. 📦 Submit to App Store and Google Play
5. 🚀 Launch with focus on AI Debate Arena as unique feature

## Release Process (MANDATORY)
- **NEVER run `eas build --profile production` or `eas submit` directly.** Use `npm run release:build` and `npm run release:submit` — they run `scripts/release/preflight-version.mjs`, which refuses to proceed unless app.json's `version` is strictly greater than the live App Store version AND every finished production build in EAS history.
- EAS remote versioning (`appVersionSource: "remote"` + `autoIncrement`) auto-increments ONLY buildNumber/versionCode. The **marketing version in app.json is manual** and must be bumped for every store release. Forgetting this has repeatedly produced unusable builds.
- Any native change also requires bumping `runtimeVersion` in app.json (keep it equal to the marketing version of the release that shipped the native change) so EAS Updates can never reach incompatible binaries.
- After changing versions: `npx expo prebuild --no-install`, verify, commit the regenerated native projects — EAS builds from the committed android/ and ios/ directories.
