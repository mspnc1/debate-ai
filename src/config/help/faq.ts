    question: 'What is Symposium AI?',
    answer:
      `Symposium AI is a mobile app for working with ${ENABLED_API_CONFIG_PROVIDER_COUNT} AI providers across chat, debate, comparison, and Create mode media generation. Our signature feature is the AI Debate Arena, where you can watch different AIs debate any topic in real time.`,

  },
  {
    id: 'faq-do-i-need-account',
    question: 'Do I need to create an account?',
    answer:
      'No account is required to use Symposium AI. Your data and API keys are stored locally on your device. You only need to provide your own API keys from AI providers to start live chats, debates, comparisons, and media generation.',
    category: 'getting-started',

  {
    id: 'faq-is-it-free',
    question: 'Is Symposium AI free?',
    answer:
      'The app includes a demo mode with pre-recorded content so you can explore without API keys. Live chats, debates, comparisons, and Create mode media generation require your own provider API keys plus an active trial or subscription. Provider API usage has its own costs.',

  // BYOK
  // ============================================
  {
    id: 'faq-what-is-byok',
    question: 'What is BYOK and why should I use it?',
    answer:
      `BYOK (Bring Your Own Keys) means you provide your own API keys from AI providers. This is more cost-effective than stacking multiple subscriptions because you pay providers only for what you use. Symposium currently supports ${ENABLED_API_CONFIG_PROVIDER_COUNT} provider connections across text and media workflows.`,

  {
    id: 'faq-what-is-web-search',
    question: 'How do I use web search with AI?',
    answer:
      'You don\'t have to do anything - web search is automatic. Models that support it search the web whenever it helps answer your question and include source citations in their response. Models without web search simply answer from their training data. There\'s no toggle to manage.',
    category: 'chat',
    relatedTopic: 'web-search',
  },
  {
    id: 'faq-web-search-providers',
    question: 'Which AIs support web search?',
    answer:
      'Web search is supported by Claude, ChatGPT (GPT-5.x and GPT-4.1 models), Gemini, Grok, and Perplexity (all Sonar models). Mistral, Cohere, and DeepSeek don\'t currently offer it. In multi-AI chats each AI is independent: the models that support search use it, and the rest respond normally.',

    id: 'faq-hallucination-shield',
    question: 'What is the Hallucination Shield?',
    answer:
      'When multiple AIs respond to the same question, they act as fact-checkers for each other. If one AI gives information that differs significantly from others, it might be a "hallucination" (AI making things up). Cross-reference responses for accuracy.',

  },
  {
    id: 'faq-chat-history',
