    question: 'What is Symposium AI?',
    answer:
      `Symposium AI is a mobile app for working with ${ENABLED_API_CONFIG_PROVIDER_COUNT} AI providers across chat, debate, comparison, and Create mode media generation. Our signature feature is the AI Debate Arena, where you can watch different AIs debate any topic in real time.`,
    category: 'getting-started',
  },
  {
    id: 'faq-do-i-need-account',
    question: 'Do I need to create an account?',
    answer:
      'No account is required to use Symposium AI. Your data and API keys are stored locally on your device. You only need to provide your own API keys from AI providers to start live chats, debates, comparisons, and media generation.',
    category: 'getting-started',
  },
  {
    id: 'faq-is-it-free',
    question: 'Is Symposium AI free?',
    answer:
      'The app includes a demo mode with pre-recorded content so you can explore without API keys. Live chats, debates, comparisons, and Create mode media generation require your own provider API keys plus an active trial or subscription. Provider API usage has its own costs.',

  // BYOK
  // ============================================
  {
    id: 'faq-what-is-byok',
    question: 'What is BYOK and why should I use it?',
    answer:
      `BYOK (Bring Your Own Keys) means you provide your own API keys from AI providers. This is more cost-effective than stacking multiple subscriptions because you pay providers only for what you use. Symposium currently supports ${ENABLED_API_CONFIG_PROVIDER_COUNT} provider connections across text and media workflows.`,

    relatedTopic: 'byok-overview',
  },
  {
    id: 'faq-where-keys-stored',
    question: 'Where are my API keys stored?',
    answer:
      'Your API keys are stored securely on your device only. They are never sent to our servers. When you chat with AIs, your device communicates directly with the AI provider\'s API.',

    relatedTopic: 'byok-security',
  },
  {
    id: 'faq-how-get-api-keys',
    question: 'How do I get API keys?',
    answer:
      'Each AI provider has a developer portal where you can generate API keys. In the API Configuration screen, tap "Get Key" for any provider - we\'ll open their key generation page with step-by-step guidance. You\'ll need to create an account with each provider you want to use.',

    relatedTopic: 'byok-getting-keys',
  },
  {
    id: 'faq-api-key-cost',
    question: 'How much do API keys cost?',
    answer:
      'API costs vary by provider and model. Typical costs are $0.01-0.03 per message for standard models, more for higher-cost models. Most casual users spend $5-15/month. Set spending limits in each provider\'s dashboard to control costs.',

  },
  {
    id: 'faq-key-not-working',
    question: 'My API key isn\'t working. What should I do?',
    answer:
      'First, verify the key is correct (no extra spaces). Check that you have billing enabled in the provider\'s dashboard - most require a payment method even for free tiers. Ensure your account isn\'t rate-limited. Try regenerating the key if issues persist.',

    question: 'Why won\'t my debate start?',

    question: 'What are AI personalities?',
    answer:

  },
  {
    id: 'faq-temperature-setting',
    question: 'What does temperature do?',
    answer:
      'Temperature controls creativity/randomness. Low temperature (0-0.5) gives focused, consistent responses - good for facts and coding. High temperature (1-2) gives more creative, varied responses - good for brainstorming and creative writing.',

  },
  {
    id: 'faq-max-tokens-setting',
    question: 'What are max tokens?',
    answer:
      'Max tokens limits response length. One token is roughly 4 characters or 0.75 words. 256 tokens ≈ 200 words (short answers), 1024 tokens ≈ 750 words (detailed responses), 4096 tokens ≈ 3000 words (long-form content).',

    question: 'How do I use web search with AI?',
    answer:
      'Look for the globe icon next to the message input. Tap it to enable web search (the icon will highlight). When enabled, the AI will search the web for current information and include source citations in its response. The toggle only appears when your selected AI supports web search.',

    id: 'faq-web-search-providers',
    question: 'Which AIs support web search?',
    answer:
      'Web search is supported by ChatGPT (GPT-5.x, GPT-4.x models), Gemini (2.0+ models), and Perplexity (all Sonar models). Claude does not currently support web search. In multi-AI mode, all selected AIs must support web search for the toggle to appear.',

  },
  {
    id: 'faq-multi-ai-benefits',
    question: 'Why chat with multiple AIs at once?',
    answer:
      'Different AIs have different strengths and perspectives. Chatting with multiple AIs lets you get diverse viewpoints, fact-check between models, and have more dynamic conversations. It\'s like consulting multiple experts simultaneously.',

    question: 'What is the Hallucination Shield?',
    answer:
      'When multiple AIs respond to the same question, they act as fact-checkers for each other. If one AI gives information that differs significantly from others, it might be a "hallucination" (AI making things up). Cross-reference responses for accuracy.',

  {
    id: 'faq-slow-responses',
    question: 'Why are responses slow?',
    answer:
      'Response speed depends on the model, your internet connection, and provider server load. Larger models and higher max token settings take longer. Try reducing max tokens for faster responses.',
