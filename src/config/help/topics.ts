1. Motion: pick a preset motion, write a custom one, or tap Surprise Me
2. Format: choose Oxford, Lincoln-Douglas, or Policy, plus a length preset
3. Debate Teams: tap a slot to add a debater, then tap it again to change its provider, model, or personality
4. Debate Settings: set the intensity (Friendly, Neutral, or Hostile); with an ElevenLabs key you can also enable Debate Voices or Podcast Mode
5. Tap Start Debate

Demo vs Live:
- Demo mode plays curated, pre-recorded debates
- Start a trial or subscription to run live debates with your API keys

Each AI will present arguments, respond to their opponent, and try to make the most compelling case. Oxford debates ask for your stance before and after the speeches; other formats ask you to vote at format-specific checkpoints.`,

Oxford Format:
Audience-voted motion debate with proposition and opposition speeches. Choose the 1v1, 2v2, or 2v2 + Q&A preset. In Q&A, you enter one audience question for each side after the first arguments. You vote before the first speech and again after the closing speeches. Best for: Public-facing debates on policy or ethics.

Lincoln-Douglas:
Philosophical debate focusing on values and ethics. Uses AC, CX, NC/1NR, 1AR, NR/2NR, and 2AR structure. Best for: Ethical dilemmas and value-based topics.

Policy Debate:
Data-driven debate with emphasis on evidence and practical solutions. Uses 1AC, 1NC, 2AC, 2NC, 1NR, 1AR, 2NR, and 2AR speech order. Best for: Current events and real-world issues.

Choosing a Preset:
The preset buttons below the format control debate length: 1v1, 2v2, and 2v2 + Q&A for Oxford; Short, Standard, and Extended for Lincoln-Douglas and Policy.`,

Oxford Voting:
Oxford uses an audience model. You cast an opening stance before the first speech, then a required final vote after the debate. The result shows whether the proposition or opposition persuaded, held, or flipped the audience.

Checkpoint Voting:
Lincoln-Douglas and Policy use format-specific checkpoint votes. At each checkpoint, choose which debater handled that part of the debate more effectively.

Voting Criteria:
Consider these factors when deciding your vote:
- Strength of arguments presented
- Quality of evidence and reasoning
- Response to opponent's points
- Clarity and persuasiveness
- Adherence to the debate format

Your Vote Matters:
Voting helps you engage critically with the debate content and track which AIs or teams perform best on different topics.

Debate History:
All your debates and votes are saved in your history, so you can review past debates and see patterns in AI performance.`,

Supported Providers:
- Claude (Anthropic)
- ChatGPT (OpenAI)
- Gemini (Google)
- Perplexity
- Mistral
- Cohere
- DeepSeek
- Grok (xAI)
- Runway (video)

1. Create an account with the AI provider
2. Navigate to their API or Developer section
3. Generate a new API key
4. Copy the key (you usually can only see it once!)
5. Paste it into Symposium AI

In-App Help:
When you tap "Get Key" for any provider in the API Configuration screen, we'll open their key generation page with step-by-step guidance.

Important:
- Keep your API keys private
- Never share keys publicly
- Set spending limits in provider dashboards
- Regenerate keys if compromised`,

    content: `Your API keys are sensitive credentials that grant access to AI services. Here's how we protect them:

Local Storage Only:
Your keys are stored only on your device using secure storage. They are never transmitted to our servers.

Direct Communication:
When you chat with AIs, your device communicates directly with the AI provider's API. We don't proxy or intercept these calls.

Best Practices:
- Set spending limits in each provider's dashboard
- Regularly review your API usage
- Regenerate keys periodically
- Don't share your device unlocked with others

If You Suspect Compromise:
Immediately regenerate your API keys in the provider's dashboard and update them in Symposium AI.`,

    content: `BYOK can significantly reduce your AI costs compared to multiple subscriptions.

The Math:
Instead of stacking several consumer AI subscriptions, you connect the provider APIs you actually need and pay those providers based on usage.

With BYOK:
Text API costs are typically usage-based and vary by model and length. Media generation has separate provider pricing based on image size, video duration, or audio length. Symposium supports ${ENABLED_API_CONFIG_PROVIDER_COUNT} provider connections, so you can choose the providers and models that fit each task.

Pay-Per-Use Benefits:
- No monthly minimums
- Scale down in light months
- Access supported providers from day one
- No feature restrictions based on tier

Tip: Start with the most affordable models (like Claude Haiku, GPT-5.6 Luna, or Gemini Flash-Lite) and upgrade to higher-cost models only when needed.`,

Where to Find It:
- Settings > Model Defaults: set each provider's default model and default parameters for all new sessions
- In the composer, tap an AI pill and open Advanced Parameters to tune the current conversation, then Save for This Session or Save as Default

What You Can Control:
- Model selection (per provider)
- Temperature: Creativity vs consistency
- Max Tokens: Response length limits
- Top-P: Response diversity
- Top-K and frequency/presence penalties (provider-dependent)

Controls are model-aware: a slider only appears when the selected model supports that parameter, and some of the newest models manage temperature automatically.

When to Use Expert Mode:
- Creative writing: Higher temperature for variety
- Factual queries: Lower temperature for accuracy
- Long-form content: Increase max tokens
- Quick answers: Decrease max tokens

Notes:
- Choosing default models is available to everyone with API keys

Scale: 0.0 to 2.0 (default usually 1.0)

Low Temperature (0.0-0.5):
- More focused and deterministic
- Consistent, predictable responses
- Best for: Factual questions, coding, analysis

Medium Temperature (0.5-1.0):
- Balanced creativity and coherence
- Good for: General conversation, explanations

High Temperature (1.0-2.0):
- More creative and varied
- Can be more surprising or unconventional
- Best for: Creative writing, brainstorming, storytelling

Tip: Start with the default and adjust based on results. Too high can produce nonsensical output.

    shortDescription: "Control response length",
    content: `Max Tokens limits how long the AI's response can be.

What Are Tokens?
Tokens are pieces of text - roughly 4 characters or 0.75 words in English. "Hello world" is about 2 tokens.

Setting Max Tokens:
- 256 tokens: ~200 words (short answers)
- 1024 tokens: ~750 words (detailed responses)
- 4096 tokens: ~3000 words (long-form content)

Cost Implications:
More tokens = higher API costs. If you're watching spending, lower max tokens for simple queries.

When to Adjust:
- Quick Q&A: 256-512 tokens
- Explanations: 1024 tokens
- Essays/stories: 2048-4096 tokens
- Code generation: 2048+ tokens

Note: The AI may stop before reaching max tokens if it completes its thought. Debate speeches are an exception - their length is set by the debate format, not this setting.`,

    shortDescription: "Control response diversity",
    content: `Top-P (also called nucleus sampling) is an alternative way to control response randomness.

Scale: 0.0 to 1.0 (default usually 1.0)

How It Works:
Top-P limits the AI to considering only the most likely next words that together make up P probability mass.

Top-P = 0.1: Only considers the top 10% most likely words
Top-P = 0.9: Considers top 90% most likely words
Top-P = 1.0: Considers all possible words

When to Adjust:
- Lower Top-P (0.1-0.5): More focused, predictable
- Higher Top-P (0.9-1.0): More diverse, creative

Temperature vs Top-P:
Both control randomness but differently. Most users adjust temperature and leave Top-P at default. Adjusting both can produce unexpected results.

Tip: If using Top-P, consider setting temperature to 1.0 and only adjusting Top-P. Not every model exposes Top-P - the slider only appears when the selected model supports it.`,

Why Round-Robin?
- See diverse perspectives on the same question
- Compare how different AIs approach problems
- Get multiple viewpoints without asking separately
- Natural flow that mimics a group discussion

Tips:
- Each AI sees all previous messages in the conversation
- AIs can reference and respond to each other's points
- Use @mentions to direct specific questions to one AI

Without @Mentions:
If you don't use an @mention, ALL selected AIs will respond to your message in round-robin order.

With @Mentions:
Only the mentioned AI will respond. Other AIs will see your message but won't reply unless mentioned.

Pro Tips:
- Use @mentions to get a specific AI's take on another's response

Image Generation:
Generate with up to 3 models at once to compare different AI interpretations of your prompt. Attach a source image to refine or edit it instead of starting from scratch.

Video Generation:
Use Runway for text-to-video, or attach an image for image-to-video.

- Grok (xAI): Fast image generation and editing
- Runway: Text-to-video and image-to-video generation
- ElevenLabs: Text-to-speech voiceovers and generated sound effects

Provider Selection:
The Image tab supports up to 3 image models at once. Tap a pill to pick the model - its sheet shows whether it can edit images and use references or creates from text prompts only.

Video and Audio:
The Video tab uses your Runway key. The Audio tab uses your ElevenLabs key and can load voices, models, and output formats from your account.

Available Styles:
- None: Your prompt as-is, no style modification
- Photo: Photorealistic, like professional photography
- Cinematic: Movie-like dramatic scenes with film grain
- Anime: Japanese animation style with vibrant colors
- Digital Art: Modern digital illustration, clean lines
- Oil Painting: Classical oil painting with visible brush strokes
- Watercolor: Soft colors with flowing washes and paper texture
- Sketch: Hand-drawn pencil sketch style
- 3D Render: CGI quality with ray tracing and studio lighting

Where to Find Styles:
On the Image tab, tap the sliders chip next to the input to open Output Options. The style you pick applies to every selected model.

How Styles Work:
When you select a style, descriptive keywords are automatically appended to your prompt to guide the AI toward that aesthetic.

Combining with Prompts:
Write your core idea in the prompt, then let the style preset handle the artistic direction. For example: "a cozy cabin in the mountains" + Watercolor style.`,

How It Works:
1. Attach a source image: tap the attach button in the composer, use Output Options > Source image (Upload image / Use latest image), or tap Refine on a gallery image
2. Describe the changes you want in the prompt
3. Tap send - every selected model that can edit images produces a refined version

Use Cases:
- Iterate on generated images to improve details
- Change the style of an existing image
- Add or remove elements from a scene
- Apply artistic effects to photos

Refinement vs New Generation:
- Without a source image, models start from scratch with just your prompt
- With a source image, models use it as a reference, maintaining composition

Which Models Can Edit:
GPT Image (OpenAI), Gemini image models (Google), and Grok can edit images and use references. Imagen models create from text only - if you attach an image, you'll be prompted to switch any model that can't edit.`,
