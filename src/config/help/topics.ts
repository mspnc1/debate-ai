Why BYOK?
Instead of paying monthly subscriptions to multiple AI services, you pay only for what you use. This can save significant money, especially if you're already subscribed to these services.

Supported Providers:
- Claude (Anthropic)
- ChatGPT (OpenAI)
- Gemini (Google)
- Perplexity
- Mistral
- Cohere
- DeepSeek
- Grok (xAI)
- Runway (video)

1. Create an account with the AI provider
2. Navigate to their API or Developer section
3. Generate a new API key
4. Copy the key (you usually can only see it once!)
5. Paste it into Symposium AI

In-App Help:
When you tap "Get Key" for any provider in the API Configuration screen, we'll open their key generation page with step-by-step guidance.

Important:
- Keep your API keys private
- Never share keys publicly
- Set spending limits in provider dashboards
- Regenerate keys if compromised`,

Local Storage Only:
Your keys are stored only on your device using secure storage. They are never transmitted to our servers.

Direct Communication:
When you chat with AIs, your device communicates directly with the AI provider's API. We don't proxy or intercept these calls.

Best Practices:
- Set spending limits in each provider's dashboard
- Regularly review your API usage
- Regenerate keys periodically
- Don't share your device unlocked with others

If You Suspect Compromise:
Immediately regenerate your API keys in the provider's dashboard and update them in Symposium AI.`,

    content: `BYOK can significantly reduce your AI costs compared to multiple subscriptions.

The Math:
Instead of stacking several consumer AI subscriptions, you connect the provider APIs you actually need and pay those providers based on usage.

With BYOK:
Text API costs are typically usage-based and vary by model and length. Media generation has separate provider pricing based on image size, video duration, or audio length. Symposium supports ${ENABLED_API_CONFIG_PROVIDER_COUNT} provider connections, so you can choose the providers and models that fit each task.

Pay-Per-Use Benefits:
- No monthly minimums
- Scale down in light months
- Access supported providers from day one
- No feature restrictions based on tier

Tip: Start with the most affordable models (like GPT-4o-mini or Claude Haiku) and upgrade to higher-cost models only when needed.`,

- Best for: Factual questions, coding, analysis

Medium Temperature (0.5-1.0):
- Balanced creativity and coherence
- Good for: General conversation, explanations

High Temperature (1.0-2.0):
- More creative and varied
- Can be more surprising or unconventional
- Best for: Creative writing, brainstorming, storytelling

    content: `Max Tokens limits how long the AI's response can be.

What Are Tokens?
Tokens are pieces of text - roughly 4 characters or 0.75 words in English. "Hello world" is about 2 tokens.

Setting Max Tokens:
- 256 tokens: ~200 words (short answers)
- 1024 tokens: ~750 words (detailed responses)
- 4096 tokens: ~3000 words (long-form content)

Cost Implications:
More tokens = higher API costs. If you're watching spending, lower max tokens for simple queries.

When to Adjust:
- Quick Q&A: 256-512 tokens
- Explanations: 1024 tokens
- Essays/stories: 2048-4096 tokens
- Code generation: 2048+ tokens

    content: `Top-P (also called nucleus sampling) is an alternative way to control response randomness.

Scale: 0.0 to 1.0 (default usually 1.0)

How It Works:
Top-P limits the AI to considering only the most likely next words that together make up P probability mass.

Top-P = 0.1: Only considers the top 10% most likely words
Top-P = 0.9: Considers top 90% most likely words
Top-P = 1.0: Considers all possible words

When to Adjust:
- Lower Top-P (0.1-0.5): More focused, predictable
- Higher Top-P (0.9-1.0): More diverse, creative

Temperature vs Top-P:
Both control randomness but differently. Most users adjust temperature and leave Top-P at default. Adjusting both can produce unexpected results.

Tip: If using Top-P, consider setting temperature to 1.0 and only adjusting Top-P.`,

For example, if you selected Claude, then ChatGPT, then Gemini:
1. You send your message
2. Claude responds first
3. ChatGPT responds second
4. Gemini responds third
5. You send another message, cycle repeats

Why Round-Robin?
- See diverse perspectives on the same question
- Compare how different AIs approach problems
- Get multiple viewpoints without asking separately
- Natural flow that mimics a group discussion

Tips:
- Each AI sees all previous messages in the conversation
- AIs can reference and respond to each other's points
- Use @mentions to direct specific questions to one AI
- All responses are clearly labeled with which AI wrote them`,

- @Gemini - Direct message to Gemini

Examples:
"@Claude, can you explain this in simpler terms?"
"@ChatGPT, what do you think of Claude's response?"
"@Gemini, can you fact-check this?"

Without @Mentions:
If you don't use an @mention, ALL selected AIs will respond to your message in round-robin order.

With @Mentions:
Only the mentioned AI will respond. Other AIs will see your message but won't reply unless mentioned.

Pro Tips:
- Use @mentions to get a specific AI's take on another's response
- Great for fact-checking between multiple AIs

How to Use:
1. Go to the Create tab
2. Choose Image, Video, or Audio
3. Enter a prompt or script
4. Choose provider-specific options such as model, style, size, duration, voice, or format
5. Tap Generate

Image Generation:
Generate images with up to 3 providers at once to compare different AI interpretations of your prompt.

Video Generation:
Use Runway for text-to-video or image-to-video workflows. You can start from a prompt, upload a source image, or use your latest generated image as the source.

Audio Generation:
Use ElevenLabs to create voiceovers from scripts or generate sound effects from prompts.

Create Gallery:
Generated images, videos, and audio are saved to your gallery. You can preview, share, manage, or delete assets, and use images as a starting point for refinements or videos.

Refinement:
Take any generated image (or upload your own) and refine it with additional prompts - perfect for iterating on ideas.`,

Supported Providers:
- OpenAI (DALL-E): High-quality image generation and editing
- Google (Imagen and Gemini image models): Photorealistic image results and refinement
- Grok (xAI): Fast image generation with artistic flair
- Runway: Text-to-video and image-to-video generation
- ElevenLabs: Text-to-speech voiceovers and generated sound effects

Provider Selection:
The Image tab supports selecting up to 3 image providers at once. Providers that support image refinement display an "img2img" badge.

Video and Audio:
The Video tab uses your Runway key. The Audio tab uses your ElevenLabs key and can load voices, models, and output formats from your account.

API Keys Required:
Each provider requires a valid API key configured in Settings > API Configuration. Media generation may have different pricing than text generation.`,

Available Styles:
- None: Your prompt as-is, no style modification
- Photo: Photorealistic, like professional photography
- Cinematic: Movie-like dramatic scenes with film grain
- Anime: Japanese animation style with vibrant colors
- Digital Art: Modern digital illustration, clean lines
- Oil Painting: Classical oil painting with visible brush strokes
- Watercolor: Soft colors with flowing washes and paper texture
- Sketch: Hand-drawn pencil sketch style
- 3D Render: CGI quality with ray tracing and studio lighting

How Styles Work:
When you select a style, descriptive keywords are automatically appended to your prompt to guide the AI toward that aesthetic.

Combining with Prompts:
Write your core idea in the prompt, then let the style preset handle the artistic direction. For example: "a cozy cabin in the mountains" + Watercolor style.`,

- Portrait (2:3): Vertical orientation, great for phone wallpapers
- Landscape (3:2): Horizontal orientation, ideal for desktop backgrounds

Provider-Specific Dimensions:
Each provider maps these options to their supported dimensions:
- OpenAI: 1024x1024 (square), 1024x1536 (portrait), 1536x1024 (landscape)
- Google: Uses aspect ratio strings (1:1, 9:16, 16:9)
- Grok: Provider default only

How It Works:
1. Select an image from your gallery OR upload your own
2. Enter a refinement prompt describing desired changes
3. Choose a provider that supports img2img
4. Generate to create a refined version

Use Cases:
- Iterate on generated images to improve details
- Change the style of an existing image
- Add or remove elements from a scene
- Apply artistic effects to photos

Refinement vs New Generation:
- New generation starts from scratch with just your prompt
- Refinement uses an existing image as a reference, maintaining composition

Supported Providers:
Look for the "img2img" badge on provider cards - these support refinement. Not all providers support this feature.`,
