# Google Play Store Setup Guide

## Prerequisites
- Google account
- $25 one-time registration fee for Google Play Developer account
- Production-ready app
- Required graphics and screenshots

## Step 1: Create Google Play Developer Account

1. Go to [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Pay the $25 registration fee
4. Complete your account details:
   - Developer name (displayed on Play Store)
   - Contact email
   - Website (optional)
   - Phone number for verification

## Step 2: Generate Production Keystore

**IMPORTANT**: Keep this keystore file safe! You'll need it for all future updates.

### Generate the keystore:
```bash
cd android/app
keytool -genkey -v -keystore symposium-ai-release.keystore -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias symposium-ai
```

You'll be prompted for:
- Keystore password (save this!)
- Key password (can be same as keystore password)
- Your name
- Organizational unit
- Organization
- City/Locality
- State/Province
- Country code (2 letters)

### Configure gradle for release builds:

1. Create `android/keystore.properties` (DO NOT commit this file):
```properties
storePassword=YOUR_STORE_PASSWORD
keyPassword=YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD
keyAlias=symposium-ai
storeFile=symposium-ai-release.keystore
```

2. Add to `.gitignore`:
```
android/keystore.properties
android/app/*.keystore
```

3. Update `android/app/build.gradle`:
```gradle
// Load keystore properties
def keystorePropertiesFile = rootProject.file("keystore.properties")
def keystoreProperties = new Properties()
if (keystorePropertiesFile.exists()) {
    keystoreProperties.load(new FileInputStream(keystorePropertiesFile))
}

android {
    ...
    signingConfigs {
        release {
            if (keystorePropertiesFile.exists()) {
                keyAlias keystoreProperties['keyAlias']
                keyPassword keystoreProperties['keyPassword']
                storeFile file(keystoreProperties['storeFile'])
                storePassword keystoreProperties['storePassword']
            }
        }
    }
    buildTypes {
        release {
            signingConfig signingConfigs.release
            minifyEnabled true
            proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android-optimize.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
        }
    }
}
```

## Step 3: Get SHA Fingerprints

### Get Release SHA-1 and SHA-256:
```bash
cd android/app
keytool -list -v -keystore symposium-ai-release.keystore -alias symposium-ai
```

Save these values - you'll need them for Firebase!

### Add to Firebase:
1. Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Project Settings
2. Under your Android app, click "Add fingerprint"
3. Add both SHA-1 and SHA-256 from release keystore
4. Download the updated `google-services.json`
5. Replace `android/app/google-services.json`

## Step 4: Build Release AAB

### Using EAS Build (Recommended):
```bash
# Configure EAS for production
eas build:configure

# Build Android release
eas build --platform android --profile production
```

### Or build locally:
```bash
cd android
./gradlew bundleRelease
```

The AAB file will be at: `android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`

## Testing Before Release

### Internal Testing (Recommended first):
1. Go to "Testing" ‚Üí "Internal testing"
2. Create internal test
3. Add tester emails (your team)
4. Upload AAB
5. Test everything thoroughly

### Closed/Open Beta:
- After internal testing succeeds
- Gradually roll out to more users
- Get feedback before production release

## Post-Launch Checklist

- [ ] Monitor crash reports in Play Console
- [ ] Respond to user reviews
- [ ] Track installation and uninstallation metrics
- [ ] Update app regularly (Google favors actively maintained apps)
- [ ] Add more screenshots/videos based on user feedback
- [ ] Consider implementing in-app reviews API
- [ ] Set up Google Play App Signing (recommended)

## SHA Fingerprint Summary

You'll have multiple SHA fingerprints:
1. **Debug SHA-1**: For development (already added)
2. **Release SHA-1**: From your keystore (add to Firebase)
3. **Google Play App Signing SHA-1**: After enabling App Signing (add to Firebase)

All must be added to Firebase for Google Sign-In to work in all scenarios.

## Common Issues

### Google Sign-In not working in production
- Ensure release SHA-1 is added to Firebase
- Download and update google-services.json
- If using App Signing, add Google's SHA-1 too

### Upload failed - version code
- Each upload needs a higher versionCode in app.json
- Increment before each build

### App rejected
Common reasons:
- Missing privacy policy
- Inappropriate content
- Misleading description
- Copyright/trademark issues
- Incomplete data safety form

## Costs

- Google Play Developer: $25 one-time
- No per-app fees
- Google takes 15% of first $1M revenue, then 30%

## Timeline

- Account approval: Instant to 48 hours
- First app review: 2-3 hours to 3 days
- Updates: Usually within 2 hours

## Next Steps

1. Create developer account
2. Generate keystore (keep it safe!)
3. Get SHA fingerprints ‚Üí Add to Firebase
4. Build release AAB
5. Create store listing with screenshots
6. Submit for review

Remember: The keystore is critical - lose it and you can't update your app!
