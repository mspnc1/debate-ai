# Tester Onboarding (iOS & Android)

This guide shows testers how to install and run both Dev Client (for development builds) and installable testing builds (TestFlight / Play Internal).

## iOS

### A) Internal Testers via TestFlight (recommended)
1. Receive an email invite from App Store Connect (TestFlight). Tap “View in TestFlight”.
2. Install TestFlight from the App Store (if not installed).
3. Open TestFlight, accept the invite for “Symposium AI”.
4. Install the latest build. Builds auto‑update.

Notes
- External testers may require the first build to pass Apple’s App Review before it appears.
- Crashes and feedback can be sent directly in TestFlight.

### B) Dev Client (for development, with Metro)
1. Open the EAS build link (development profile) in Safari on your device and install the Dev Client.
2. Connect your device and computer to the same network.
3. Start Metro: `npx expo start --dev-client`.
4. Open the Dev Client app and scan the QR code shown in your terminal/Expo Dev Tools.

## Android

### A) Internal Testing via Play Console (recommended)
1. You’ll receive a Play Store link from the team for the Internal Testing track.
2. Opt in to become a tester.
3. Open the Play Store app, search for “Symposium AI” and install the Internal Testing build.

Notes
- Testing tracks can be “Internal”, “Closed”, or “Open”. Internal is fastest.
- You may need to wait a few minutes after opt‑in for the build to appear.

### B) Dev Client (for development, with Metro)
1. Install the Dev Client APK built with the `development` profile. Options:
   - USB install: `eas build:run -p android --profile development`
   - Or download the APK from the EAS link, then `adb install <apk>`
2. Start Metro: `npx expo start --dev-client`.
3. Open the Dev Client app and scan the QR code from the terminal/Dev Tools.

## QR Codes & Links
- EAS will show a QR code after each build on the EAS dashboard. You can share that QR with testers to install the Dev Client (Android APK) or to open the iOS install page.
- For TestFlight and Play Internal builds, share the invite links generated by App Store Connect and Google Play Console.

## Troubleshooting
- If the app doesn’t load in Dev Client, ensure your device and computer are on the same network and Metro is running.
- If you see “Update available” screens or content mismatches, the app may be using OTA updates (EAS Update). Restart the app or wait a moment.
- For TestFlight: If you don’t see the app, check that you accepted the invite and the build is available for your tester group.
- For Play Internal: Ensure you joined the test via the opt‑in link and signed into the correct Google account on the device.
