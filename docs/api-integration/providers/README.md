# Provider Docs Overview

Each provider folder contains living docs for integration:

- `quick-start.md`: Auth, SDK/client setup, minimal request/response.
- `advanced-features.md`: Streaming, function/tool calling, system prompts.
- `best-practices.md`: Rate limits, retries, safety, cost tips.
- `models.md`: Generated model catalog; run `npm run discover:models` to refresh.

Review generated files before committing. Discovery uses test keys from `.env.local` only.
