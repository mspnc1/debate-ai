- **Privacy**: Never synced to cloud; never included in logs or analytics
- **Validation**: Quick metadata call on save with strict timeout
- **UX**: Provider setup wizard with deep links to provider documentation
- **Feature Gate**: Demo users see upgrade prompt when attempting configuration

- **Navigation**: Full app UI accessible in read-only mode
- **Upgrade Prompts**: Strategic placement at friction points
- **Authentication**: Supports anonymous Firebase auth for tracking
- **Offline Ready**: Assets bundled under `src/assets/demo/`

### Demo Content Types
1. **Debates**: 5-10 pre-recorded AI debates on popular topics
2. **Round-Robin Chats**: 5-10 multi-AI conversations
3. **Comparisons**: 5-10 side-by-side AI response comparisons
